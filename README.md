# Movie Maker

## Description
The purpose of this project was to use NodeJS, Grunt and Browserify in a more complex manner. This app allows a user to enter in a movie budget and then add different movie elements to their movie. Each movie element costs a certain amount of money. If the user goes over budget, they cannot make the movie. If the user does not include one movie element from each category, they cannot make the movie. Styling was kept fairly simple on this app, the focus was on functionality.
